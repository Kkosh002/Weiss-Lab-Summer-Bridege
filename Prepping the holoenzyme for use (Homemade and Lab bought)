The holoenzyme consists of the RNAP core and Sigma 70 and weighs approximately 470= kDa (1 Da = 1 g/mol) 

The holoenzyme can be made in the lab by combining the RNAP core and sigma, and incubating or the entire holoenzyme can be bought commercially

Prepping the Holoenzyme from core and sigma. 
1. The core is roughly 400 kDa and comes in a 7 mg/mL ~ 17.5 uM solution. 
  The core can be made the limiting reagent, by creating a 10 fold dilution, or a 1.75 uM solution 
    (2 uL and 18 uL 1x txn b +++) 
2. Sigma is approx. 70 kDa and comes in 1.13 mg/mL ~ 16 uM concentration. 
  Keeping a very rough 10 times concentration sigma to core will (under LeChatlier's Principle) give closer 1:1 binding ratio of sigma to core than just a 1:1 concentration reaction
3. Combine 4 uL of the 10 fold diluted RNAP core solution (from step one 1.75 uM), 2 uL of the sigma (from step two 16 uM), and 13 uL of 1x txn b +++ (or 10 uL 2x txn b +++ and 3 uL of sterile water) 
4. incubate for 30 minutes at 37 deg C. 

Prepping the commercially bought holoenzyme 
1. The holoenzyme comes in a 1.7 mg/mL ~ 3.62 uM solution, dispense 2 uL of this stock into 17 uL of 1x txn b +++ (or 10 uL 2x txn b +++ and 7 uL of sterile water) 
2. incubate for 30 minutes at 37 deg C. 


This is assuming we do not add herapin or NTPs (adjust the volume of txn b to account for these)
