This makes the 2x transcription buffer (txn b) with BSA, DTT, and MEA (txn b +++) that can be used in experimentation

Add 497 uL of the 2x txn b without DTT, MEA, or BSA (txn b ---), and place into centri. tube 
To the 2x txb b ---, add 1 uL BSA (100 mg/mL), 1 uL DTT (1 M), and 1 uL MEA (1 uL)
pipette mix the solution together. 

This makes the 2x txn b +++ that *can* be used in experimentation. 
The final concentration of DTT and MEA should be 1uM in the final solution 

However, it is more common to use 1x buffer, in this case take, ~ 400 uL of 2x txn b +++ and dilute with 400 uL of sterile water.
