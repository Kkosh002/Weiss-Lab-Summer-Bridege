Make 2x Transcription Buffer (Salt Only)

Exact amounts of HEPES, KCl, and MgCl2 
HEPES (238.30 g/mol): 0.953 g (buffering agent 4 mM solution)
KCl (74.55 g/mol): 0.373 g (5 mM  in solution)
MgCl2 (95.21 g/mol): 0.208 g (5 mM in solution) 

Combine approximate values of each component into a beaker and dissovle into ~30 mL of Milipore water.  
Take the pH (should be ~5) 
add concentrated KOH until the pH is approx. 6.4-6.5 (this is only about 1 drop of concentrated KOH) 
Transfer sol'n to a graduated cyclinder and bring to roughly 48.75 mL (this accounts for a few other materials that will be added. 
Transfer the sol'n back into the beaker and take the pH, bring pH up to 7.0 (+/-) 0.5 pH units.  
Syringe filter into sterile 50 mL centri. tube.  
Separate into ~ 1 mL aliquots.
