This gives 10 uL of 100 pM labeled DNA 

Using the stock solution of 1 uM labeled DNA deliver 1 uL to 9 uL of 1x txn b +++ to get a stock solution of 100 nmm labeled DNA. 
To get the 1000 fold diilution needed for single molecule detection, serial dilute the 100 nM stock solution. 

Serial dilution of 100 nM DNA 
1 uL of 100 nM DNA in 99 uL of 1x txn b +++ gives a 1 nM labeled DNA solution.  
1 uL of 1 nM DNA in 9 uL of 1x txn b +++ gives the final 100 pM DNA solution needed.
